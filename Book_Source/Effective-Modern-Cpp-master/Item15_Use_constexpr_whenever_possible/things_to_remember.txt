                               Things to Remember
                               ------------------

* constexpr objects are const and are initialized with values know during
  compilation.

* constexpr functions can produce compile-time results when called with
  arguments whose values are known during compilation.

* constexpr objects and functions may be used in a wider range of contexts than
  non-constexpr objects and functions.

* constexpr is part of an object's or function's interface.
