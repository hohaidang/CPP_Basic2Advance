                               Things to Remember
                               ------------------

* Make std::threads unjoinable on all paths.

* join-on-destruction can lead to difficult-to-debug performance anomalies.

* detach-on-destruction can lead to difficult-to-debug undefined behavior.

* Declare std::thread objects last in lists of data members.
