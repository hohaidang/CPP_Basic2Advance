                               Things to Remember
                               ------------------

* Apply std::move to rvalue references and std::forward to universal references
  the last time each is used.

* Do the same thing for rvalue references and universal references being
  returned from functions that return by value.

* Never apply std::move or std::forward to local objects if they would otherwise
  be eligible for the return value optimization.
