                               Things to Remember
                               ------------------

* Alternatives to the combination of universal references and overloading
  include the use of distinct function names, passing parameters by
  lvalue-reference-to-const, passing parameters by value, and using tag
  dispatch.

* Constraining templates via std::enable_if permits the use of universal
  references and overloading together, but it controls the conditions under
  which compilers may use the universal reference overloads.

* Universal reference parameters often have efficiency advantages, but they
  typically have usability disadvantages.
