                               Things to Remember
                               ------------------

* The std::thread API offers no direct way to get return values from
  asynchronously run functions, and if those functions throw, the program is
  terminated.

* Thread-based programming calls for manual management of thread exhaustion,
  oversubscription, load balancing, and adaptation to new platforms.

* Task-based programming via std::async with the default launch policy handles
  most of these issues for you.
