                               Things to Remember
                               ------------------

* Reference collapsing occurs in four contexts: template instantiation, auto
  type generation, creation and use of typedefs and alias declarations, and
  decltype.

* When compilers generate a reference to a reference in a reference collapsing
  context, the result becomes a single reference.  If either of the original
  references is an lvalue reference, the result is an lvalue reference.
  Otherwise it's an rvalue reference.

* Universal references are rvalue references in contexts where type deduction
  distinguishes lvalues from rvalues and where reference collapsing occurs.
