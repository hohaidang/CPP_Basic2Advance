                               Things to Remember
                               ------------------

* Overloading on universal references almost always leads to the universal
  reference overload being called more frequently than expected.

* Perfect-forwarding constructors are especially problematic, because they're
  typically better matches than copy constructors for non-const lvalues, and
  they can hijack derived class calls to base class copy and move constructors.
