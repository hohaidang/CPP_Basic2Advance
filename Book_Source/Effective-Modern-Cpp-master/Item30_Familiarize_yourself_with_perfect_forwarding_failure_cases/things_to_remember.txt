                               Things to Remember
                               ------------------

* Perfect forwarding fails when template type deduction fails or when it deduces
  the wrong type.

* The kinds of arguments that lead to perfect forwarding failure are braced
  initializers, null pointers expressed as 0 or NULL, declaration-only integral
  const static data members, template and overloaded function names, and
  bitfields.
