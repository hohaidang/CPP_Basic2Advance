                               Things to Remember
                               ------------------

* typedefs don't support templatization, but alias declarations do.

* Alias templates avoid the "::type" suffix and, in templates, the "typename"
  prefix often required to refer to typedefs.

* C++14 offers alias templates for all the C++11 type traits transformations.
