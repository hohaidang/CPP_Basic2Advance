                               Things to Remember
                               ------------------

* The default launch policy for std::async permits both asynchronous and
  synchronous task execution.

* This flexibility leads to uncertainty when accessing thread_locals, implies
  that the task may never execute, and affects program logic for timeout-based
  wait calls.

* Specify std::launch::async if asynchronous task execution is essential.
